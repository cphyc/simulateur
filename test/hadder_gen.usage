Produce a batch input file adapted to hadder.net

h(undred)adder.net is a netlist produced with 'mjc.byte test/nadder.mj' (minijazz compiler
provided with TP1), which adds two integers a and b, written in binary
strings of length n.

	~/(...)/simulateur/test $ ocaml hadder_gen.ml > hadder.b

input : 2 integers
- nb of cycles (nb of additions to do)
- n

output :
(nb cycles)
(nb cycles) lines with two pseudo-random binary strings of length n

Execution on the result :

	~/(...)/simulateur $ ./main.byte -b test/hadder.b test/hadder.net

function arrays are faster
